    <p align="center">END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</p>
    <p align="left">  <strong>1. Scope</strong>. This end user license agreement (“EULA”) is between you (“You” or “Your”) and NetApp, Inc. and (as
      applicable) its subsidiaries and affiliates (“NetApp”). This EULA sets forth the terms under which NetApp licenses the
    Software and Documentation to You.</p>
    <p align="left">  In this EULA:<br>
      a) “Documentation” means technical documentation describing the features and functions of the associated<br>
      Software;<br>
      b) “NetApp Partner” means an authorized NetApp distributor, reseller or other channel partner; and<br>
      c) “Software” means NetApp software in object code format including (as applicable) operating systems, protocols,
      backup and recovery, disaster recovery, storage efficiency and management software.<br>
      <br>
      In the absence of a more specific written agreement, this EULA applies to Software and Documentation obtained by You
      directly from NetApp, indirectly from a NetApp Partner, or made available to you by NetApp at no charge. The types,
      quantities and other usage attributes related to Your Software licenses are specified in other documents associated with the
      Software, including (as applicable) the Documentation, a NetApp quote or related document (for direct transactions), or
      the corresponding documents from a NetApp Partner (for indirect transactions).<br>
      <br>
      This EULA does not entitle You to receive Software updates, upgrades, technical support or professional services, which
      must be purchased or provided separately.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>2. Acceptance. By clicking the “I ACCEPT” button when downloading or installing the Software, or by copying,
      accessing or using the Software or Documentation, You agree that this EULA will exclusively govern NetApp’s
      license and Your use of the Software and Documentation unless You have a separate applicable written agreement
      with NetApp governing the same. If You are accepting this EULA on behalf of another person, company or other
      legal entity, whether as an employee, contractor, distributor, reseller, partner, agent or otherwise, You represent
      and warrant that You have full authority to bind them. If You do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not
      download, install, copy, access, or use the Software or Documentation, or click the “I ACCEPT” button, and
      promptly return the Software and Documentation to the party from whom it was obtained.</strong><br>
      <br>
      <strong>3. License Grant.</strong> NetApp grants to You a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, worldwide, limited and revocable license, without the right to sublicense, to i) install and use the Software for Your internal business purposes only, and ii) use the Documentation in support of Your use of the Software.<br>
      <br>
      The Software associated with Your license is either bundled with a specific storage controller identified by a unique serial
      number (“Controller-based”), or is independent of a storage controller (“Standalone”), and Your license is one of the
      following license types:  a) “Life-of-controller”: Controller-based licenses granted for the period of time during which Your storage controller is operable; b) “Perpetual”: Standalone licenses granted in perpetuity;
      c) “Term”: Controller-based licenses or Standalone licenses granted for a fixed period of time;
      d) “Capacity”: Controller-based licenses or Standalone licenses granted for a specified amount of raw storage
      capacity, number of hosts or other measure of usage; and e) “Subscription”: Controller-based licenses or Standalone licenses which may be purchased on a periodic basis.<br>
      <br>
      Certain license types may require the installation and use of NetApp’s AutoSupportTM remote support diagnostics system.<br>
      <br>
      Each storage controller deployed in a cluster or a high-availability pair or group must have the same Controller-based
      license as the other storage controllers in that cluster, high-availability pair or group. Subject to NetApp’s separate written
      agreement, and in the context of non-disruptive operations within a cluster, You may deploy storage controllers with
      different Controller-based licenses and failover from one storage controller to another for the time required to remedy a<br>
      failure, provided that all storage controllers in the cluster have the same hardware and software support offerings in effect
      at all times.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>4. License Restrictions.</strong> You shall not, nor shall You allow any third party to:
      <br>
      a) reverse-engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software or otherwise reduce it to human-readable format except
      to the extent required for interoperability purposes under applicable laws or as expressly permitted in opensource
      licenses;<br>
      b) remove or conceal any product identification, proprietary, intellectual property or other notices in the Software or
      Documentation;
      c) use the Software or Documentation to perform services for third parties in a service bureau, managed services,
      commercial hosting services or similar environment;<br>
      d) assign or otherwise transfer, in whole or in part, the Software or Documentation licenses to another party or
      Controller-based licenses to a different storage controller;<br>
      e) install Controller-based licenses on or use them with third party hardware or any second-hand or grey market
      NetApp hardware not purchased by You from NetApp or a NetApp Partner;<br>
      f) modify, adapt or create a derivative work of the Software or Documentation; and<br>
      g) publish or provide any Software benchmark or comparison test results.<br>

      retain all rights not expressly granted to You. No right, title or interest to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name,
      of NetApp or its licensors is granted to You.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>6. Direct Warranty.</strong> NetApp warrants that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of first delivery of the Software
      to You or a NetApp Partner, whichever is the earlier, or such other minimum periods under applicable laws (the “Software
      Warranty Period”), that i) the Software will materially conform to the then-current Documentation, and ii) the Software
      media will be free from defects. NetApp does not warrant that Your use of the Software will be error-free or uninterrupted.
      If a material defect arises in the Software during the Software Warranty Period and if the defect is reproducible and
      verifiable, NetApp will, at its sole discretion and expense, repair or replace the defective Software or refund the amounts
      actually received by NetApp for the Software. The Software warranty will be voided if You or any third parties misuse,
      neglect, attempt to repair or modify (unless authorized by NetApp), or use the Software beyond the range of the intended
      use. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, THIS IS YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
      WARRANTY AND REMEDY. NETAPP SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING
      THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY, ACCEPTABLE QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>7. Limitation of Liability.</strong> Regardless of the basis of the claim (e.g. contract, tort or statute), the total liability of NetApp and its licensors, under or in connection with this EULA, shall not exceed the amounts actually received by NetApp for the Software or the minimum amounts permitted by applicable laws, if greater.

      a) any indirect, consequential, incidental, exemplary or special damages;<br>
      b) loss or corruption of data;<br>
      c) loss of revenues, profits, goodwill or anticipated savings;<br>

      regulations.<br>
      <br>
      The limitations and exclusions above shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, gross  negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or any other liability that cannot be excluded under applicable laws.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>8. Audit.</strong> Upon reasonable notice, You grant NetApp and its independent accountants the right to examine Your Software usage to verify compliance with this EULA. If the audit discloses over-usage or any other material non-compliance, You
      will promptly pay to NetApp or to a NetApp Partner, as designated by NetApp, any additional fees notified to you and the
      reasonable costs of conducting the audit.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>9. Termination.</strong> This EULA is effective until expiration or termination. You may terminate the EULA at any time on
      written notice to NetApp. NetApp may terminate the EULA immediately on written notice for material breach of the EULA. Any failure to remit payments in relation to the Software and Documentation when due, whether payable to NetApp or a NetApp Partner, shall constitute a material breach of this EULA. Upon expiration or termination of this<br>
      EULA, You will promptly return or destroy all copies of the Software and Documentation, including any license enablement keys. Sections 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 shall survive expiration or termination of this EULA.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>10. Software Copyright Information And Notices.</strong> Software copyright information and other related details are included as part of notices in the Documentation or other documentation published by NetApp (e.g. NOTICES.TXT or NOTICES. PDF).<br>

      subject to export controls under the laws and regulations of the United States, the European Union and other countries as
      applicable, and the Software may include export controlled technologies, including without limitation encryption
      technology. You agree to comply with such laws and regulations and, in particular, represent and warrant that You:<br>
      a) shall not, unless authorized by U.S. export licenses or other government authorizations, directly or indirectly
      export or re-export the Software and Documentation to or use the Software and Documentation in countries

      c) will not use the Software and Documentation for any purposes prohibited by U.S. law, including but without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of nuclear, missile, chemical biological weaponry or other weapons of mass destruction.<br>
      <br>
      You agree to provide NetApp end use and end user information upon NetApp’s request. You shall obtain all required   authorizations, permits, or licenses to export, re-export or import, as required. You agree to obligate, by contract or other 
      similar assurances, the parties to whom You re-export or otherwise transfer the Software to comply with all obligations set forth in this Section 11.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>12. Data Privacy.</strong> You have sole responsibility for the personal data you choose to manage and/or store using the  Software and agree to comply with all applicable data privacy laws.

      privacy laws.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>13. U.S. Federal Government End Users.</strong> This Section 13 applies to You only if You are a U.S. Federal Government end user. The Software and Documentation is “commercial” computer software and documentation and is licensed to You in 
      accordance with the rights articulated in applicable U.S. government acquisition regulations (e.g. FAR, DFARs) pertaining
      to commercial computer software and documentation. You shall not be subject to applicable audit costs specified in Section 8. Any dispute between You and NetApp will be subject to resolution pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of<br>

      U.S.C. §516. All other provisions of this EULA remain in effect as written.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>14. General.</strong> This EULA will be construed pursuant to the laws of i) the State of California, United States, excluding its conflicts of law provisions, if You are located in the United States or in a country in which NetApp has no local salessubsidiary, or ii) the country in which You are located if NetApp has a local sales subsidiary in that country. NetApp
      reserves the right to control all aspects of any lawsuit or claim that arises from Your use of the Software or Documentation.<br>
      If required by NetApp’s agreement with a third party licensor, NetApp’s licensor will be a direct and intended third party beneficiary of this EULA and may enforce it directly against You. NetApp does not waive any of its rights under this EULA by failing to or delaying the exercise of its rights or partially exercising its rights at any time. To the extent that any Section of this EULA, or part thereof, is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this EULA shall<br>
      remain in full force and effect. This EULA may not be changed except by a written amendment executed by an authorized  representative of each party. In the event of a dispute between the English and non-English version of the EULA (where translated for local requirements), the English version of this EULA shall govern, to the extent permitted by applicable laws. This EULA represents the entire agreement and understanding between NetApp and You with respect to the<br>
      Software and Documentation. It supersedes any previous communications, representations or agreements between NetApp and You and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms in any quote, purchase order, acknowledgment, or similar communication between the parties.</p>

Further, NetApp is not responsible for losses, damages or claims attributable to the Cloud Provider's acts, omissions, negligence or intentional acts of any kind in connection with Your use of the Software Subscription.   </p>
    <p><strong>9. Audit.</strong> You grant NetApp and its independent accountants the right to examine Your Subscription  usage once annually during regular business hours upon reasonable notice to verify compliance with this Agreement or to otherwise permit NetApp or the Cloud Provider to verify the number of Instances used by You.  If the audit discloses material non-compliance, You shall promptly pay to NetApp any additional use fees identified by NetApp, calculated in accordance with NetApp's price list, and the reasonable costs of conducting such audit, if any.  Following any non-compliance, you may be subjected to more frequent audits or terminated pursuant to Section 11. </p>
    <p><strong>10. Tax. </strong>Fees  and other charges associated with this Agreement may not include federal, state  or local sales, VAT, GST, foreign withholding, use, property, excise, service  or similar taxes in most jurisdictions (“Tax”) now or in the future, all of  which are Your responsibility.

You agree to indemnify NetApp for any Tax and related  costs, interests, and penalties paid or payable by NetApp for Your use of the Subscription.</p>

You may terminate the Agreement at any time with  written notice. NetApp may terminate  this Agreement immediately on written notice to You if You commit a material  breach of the Agreement, including  failure to remit payments when due and, in the event that the breach is  remediable, failure to remedy it within thirty (30) days of NetApp’s written  notice requiring You to do so. Upon  termination of this Agreement, all rights to use the Software and Documentation  cease and You shall, at NetApp’s request, promptly return or destroy all copies  of the Software and Documentation, including any Keys, in Your possession or  under Your control. Sections 1, 2, 4, 5,  and 7 through 16 (as well as any defined terms, technology use restrictions, or  Your provided consents) shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>

  <p align="center">END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</p>
  <p align="left"> 
    <strong>1. Scope</strong>.
    This end user license agreement (“EULA”) is between you (“You” or “Your”) and NetApp, Inc. and (as
    applicable) its subsidiaries and affiliates (“NetApp”). This EULA sets forth the terms under which NetApp licenses the
    Software and Documentation to You.
  </p>
<p align="left">  
  In this EULA:<br>
  a) “Documentation” means technical documentation describing the features and functions of the associated<br>
  Software;<br>
  b) “NetApp Partner” means an authorized NetApp distributor, reseller or other channel partner; and<br>
  c) “Software” means NetApp software in object code format including (as applicable) operating systems, protocols,
  backup and recovery, disaster recovery, storage efficiency and management software.<br>
  <br>
  In the absence of a more specific written agreement, this EULA applies to Software and Documentation obtained by You
  directly from NetApp, indirectly from a NetApp Partner, or made available to you by NetApp at no charge. The types,
  quantities and other usage attributes related to Your Software licenses are specified in other documents associated with the
  Software, including (as applicable) the Documentation, a NetApp quote or related document (for direct transactions), or
  the corresponding documents from a NetApp Partner (for indirect transactions).<br>
  <br>
  This EULA does not entitle You to receive Software updates, upgrades, technical support or professional services, which
  must be purchased or provided separately.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2. Acceptance. By clicking the “I ACCEPT” button when downloading or installing the Software, or by copying,
  accessing or using the Software or Documentation, You agree that this EULA will exclusively govern NetApp’s
  license and Your use of the Software and Documentation unless You have a separate applicable written agreement
  with NetApp governing the same. If You are accepting this EULA on behalf of another person, company or other
  legal entity, whether as an employee, contractor, distributor, reseller, partner, agent or otherwise, You represent
  and warrant that You have full authority to bind them. If You do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not
  download, install, copy, access, or use the Software or Documentation, or click the “I ACCEPT” button, and
  promptly return the Software and Documentation to the party from whom it was obtained.</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>3. License Grant.</strong> NetApp grants to You a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, worldwide, limited and revocable license, without the right to sublicense, to i) install and use the Software for Your internal business purposes only, and ii) use the Documentation in support of Your use of the Software.<br>
  <br>
  The Software associated with Your license is either bundled with a specific storage controller identified by a unique serial
  number (“Controller-based”), or is independent of a storage controller (“Standalone”), and Your license is one of the
  following license types:  a) “Life-of-controller”: Controller-based licenses granted for the period of time during which Your storage controller is operable; b) “Perpetual”: Standalone licenses granted in perpetuity;
  c) “Term”: Controller-based licenses or Standalone licenses granted for a fixed period of time;
  d) “Capacity”: Controller-based licenses or Standalone licenses granted for a specified amount of raw storage
  capacity, number of hosts or other measure of usage; and e) “Subscription”: Controller-based licenses or Standalone licenses which may be purchased on a periodic basis.<br>
  <br>
  Certain license types may require the installation and use of NetApp’s AutoSupportTM remote support diagnostics system.<br>
  <br>
  Each storage controller deployed in a cluster or a high-availability pair or group must have the same Controller-based
  license as the other storage controllers in that cluster, high-availability pair or group. Subject to NetApp’s separate written
  agreement, and in the context of non-disruptive operations within a cluster, You may deploy storage controllers with
  different Controller-based licenses and failover from one storage controller to another for the time required to remedy a<br>
  failure, provided that all storage controllers in the cluster have the same hardware and software support offerings in effect
  at all times.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>4. License Restrictions.</strong> You shall not, nor shall You allow any third party to:
  <br>
  a) reverse-engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software or otherwise reduce it to human-readable format except
  to the extent required for interoperability purposes under applicable laws or as expressly permitted in opensource
  licenses;<br>
  b) remove or conceal any product identification, proprietary, intellectual property or other notices in the Software or
  Documentation;
  c) use the Software or Documentation to perform services for third parties in a service bureau, managed services,
  commercial hosting services or similar environment;<br>
  d) assign or otherwise transfer, in whole or in part, the Software or Documentation licenses to another party or
  Controller-based licenses to a different storage controller;<br>
  e) install Controller-based licenses on or use them with third party hardware or any second-hand or grey market
  NetApp hardware not purchased by You from NetApp or a NetApp Partner;<br>
  f) modify, adapt or create a derivative work of the Software or Documentation; and<br>
  g) publish or provide any Software benchmark or comparison test results.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>5. Intellectual Property Rights</strong>. The Software and Documentation is licensed, not sold, to You. It is protected by
  intellectual property laws and treaties worldwide, and contains trade secrets, in which NetApp and its licensors reserve and
  retain all rights not expressly granted to You. No right, title or interest to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name,
  of NetApp or its licensors is granted to You.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>6. Direct Warranty.</strong> NetApp warrants that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of first delivery of the Software
  to You or a NetApp Partner, whichever is the earlier, or such other minimum periods under applicable laws (the “Software
  Warranty Period”), that i) the Software will materially conform to the then-current Documentation, and ii) the Software
  media will be free from defects. NetApp does not warrant that Your use of the Software will be error-free or uninterrupted.
  If a material defect arises in the Software during the Software Warranty Period and if the defect is reproducible and
  verifiable, NetApp will, at its sole discretion and expense, repair or replace the defective Software or refund the amounts
  actually received by NetApp for the Software. The Software warranty will be voided if You or any third parties misuse,
  neglect, attempt to repair or modify (unless authorized by NetApp), or use the Software beyond the range of the intended
  use. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, THIS IS YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
  WARRANTY AND REMEDY. NETAPP SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING
  THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY, ACCEPTABLE QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>7. Limitation of Liability.</strong> Regardless of the basis of the claim (e.g. contract, tort or statute), the total liability of NetApp and its licensors, under or in connection with this EULA, shall not exceed the amounts actually received by NetApp for the Software or the minimum amounts permitted by applicable laws, if greater. NetApp and its licensors are not liable for:<br>
  a) any indirect, consequential, incidental, exemplary or special damages;<br>
  b) loss or corruption of data;<br>
  c) loss of revenues, profits, goodwill or anticipated savings;<br>
  d) procurement of substitute goods and/or services;<br>
  e) interruption to business; and<br>
  f) Your failure to adhere to applicable regulations pertaining to non-rewriteable and non-erasable US Government
  regulations.<br>
  <br>
  The limitations and exclusions above shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, gross  negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or any other liability that cannot be excluded under applicable laws.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>8. Audit.</strong> Upon reasonable notice, You grant NetApp and its independent accountants the right to examine Your Software usage to verify compliance with this EULA. If the audit discloses over-usage or any other material non-compliance, You
  will promptly pay to NetApp or to a NetApp Partner, as designated by NetApp, any additional fees notified to you and the
  reasonable costs of conducting the audit.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>9. Termination.</strong> This EULA is effective until expiration or termination. You may terminate the EULA at any time on
  written notice to NetApp. NetApp may terminate the EULA immediately on written notice for material breach of the EULA. Any failure to remit payments in relation to the Software and Documentation when due, whether payable to NetApp or a NetApp Partner, shall constitute a material breach of this EULA. Upon expiration or termination of this<br>
  EULA, You will promptly return or destroy all copies of the Software and Documentation, including any license enablement keys. Sections 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 shall survive expiration or termination of this EULA.<br>
