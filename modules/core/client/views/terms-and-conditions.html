<ul style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>
        <b>Scope.</b> This end user license agreement (“EULA”) is between you (“You” or “Your”) and NetApp, Inc. and (as applicable) its subsidiaries and affiliates (“NetApp”).  This EULA sets forth the terms under which NetApp licenses the Software and Documentation to You
        <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">In this EULA:
            <li>“Documentation” means technical documentation describing the features and functions of the associated Software;</li>
            <li>“NetApp Partner” means an authorized NetApp distributor, reseller or other channel partner; and</li>
            <li>“Software” means NetApp software in object code format including (as applicable) operating systems, protocols, backup and recovery, disaster recovery, storage efficiency and management software.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In the absence of a more specific written agreement, this EULA applies to Software and Documentation obtained by You directly from NetApp, indirectly from a NetApp Partner, or made available to you by NetApp at no charge.  The types, quantities and other usage attributes related to Your Software licenses are specified in other documents associated with the Software, including (as applicable) the Documentation, a NetApp quote or related document (for direct transactions), or the corresponding documents from a NetApp Partner (for indirect transactions).
            This EULA does not entitle You to receive Software updates, upgrades, technical support or professional services, which must be purchased or provided separately.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Acceptance. By clicking the “I ACCEPT” button when downloading or installing the Software, or by copying, accessing or using the Software or Documentation, You agree that this EULA will exclusively govern NetApp’s license and Your use of the Software and Documentation unless You have a separate applicable written agreement with NetApp governing the same.  If You are accepting this EULA on behalf of another person, company or other legal entity, whether as an employee, contractor, distributor, reseller, partner, agent or otherwise, You represent and warrant that You have full authority to bind them.  If You do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not download, install, copy, access, or use the Software or Documentation, or click the “I ACCEPT” button, and promptly return the Software and Documentation to the party from whom it was obtained.</b>
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            <b>License Grant.</b> NetApp grants to You a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, worldwide, limited and revocable license, without the right to sublicense, to i) install and use the Software for Your internal business purposes only, and ii) use the Documentation in support of Your use of the Software.
            The Software associated with Your license is either bundled with a specific storage controller identified by a unique serial number (“Controller-based”), or is independent of a storage controller (“Standalone”), and Your license is one of the following license types: 
            <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                <li>“Life-of-controller”: Controller-based licenses granted for the period of time during which Your storage controller is operable;</li>
                <li>“Perpetual”: Standalone licenses granted in perpetuity;</li>
                <li>“Term”: Controller-based licenses or Standalone licenses granted for a fixed period of time;</li>
                <li>“Capacity”: Controller-based licenses or Standalone licenses granted for a specified amount of raw storage capacity, number of hosts or other measure of usage; and</li>
                <li>“Subscription”: Controller-based licenses or Standalone licenses which may be purchased on a periodic basis.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Certain license types may require the installation and use of NetApp’s AutoSupport™ remote support diagnostics system.Each storage controller deployed in a cluster or a high-availability pair or group must have the same Controller-based license as the other storage controllers in that cluster, high-availability pair or group.  Subject to NetApp’s separate written agreement, and in the context of non-disruptive operations within a cluster, You may deploy storage controllers with different Controller-based licenses and failover from one storage controller to another for the time required to remedy a failure, provided that all storage controllers in the cluster have the same hardware and software support offerings in effect at all times.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>License Restrictions.</b> You shall not, nor shall You allow any third party to:
